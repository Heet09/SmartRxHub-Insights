# UI Refactoring and Chatbot Fixes

This document summarizes the significant changes made to the SmartRxHub-Insights project, focusing on the Streamlit dashboard's UI refactoring and the resolution of issues related to the chatbot's Gemini API integration.

## 1. Streamlit UI Refactoring

The original single-page Streamlit dashboard (`streamlit_dashboard.py`) has been refactored into a multi-page application for better organization, user experience, and maintainability.

### Key Changes:

*   **Multi-Page Structure:** The dashboard is now divided into three distinct pages, accessible via the Streamlit sidebar:
    *   `dashboard/pages/1_üè†_Overview.py`: Provides a high-level overview with key performance indicators (KPIs) and general risk distribution charts.
    *   `dashboard/pages/2_üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è_Patient_Deep_Dive.py`: Allows users to select a specific patient and view their detailed records and recommendations.
    *   `dashboard/pages/3_ü§ñ_Risk_Chatbot.py`: A dedicated page for interacting with the SmartRxHub chatbot.
*   **Centralized Data Loading:** The `load_data` function, which fetches data from the database, has been moved to a shared utility file to eliminate code duplication and ensure consistency across all dashboard pages.
    *   **New File:** `dashboard/utils.py`
    *   **Change in `dashboard/utils.py`:** The `load_data` function now also includes logic to standardize the `allergies` column, converting lists or other non-string types into comma-separated strings to prevent `pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid` errors when displaying DataFrames.
*   **Custom Streamlit Theme:** A custom theme has been applied to enhance the visual appeal and provide a more professional look and feel.
    *   **New File:** `.streamlit/config.toml`
    *   **Theme Configuration:**
        ```toml
        [theme]
        primaryColor="#6EB52F"
        backgroundColor="#F0F2F6"
        secondaryBackgroundColor="#FFFFFF"
        textColor="#262730"
        font="sans serif"
        ```
*   **Main Entry Point Update:** The original `streamlit_dashboard.py` was removed, and a new `dashboard/Home.py` was created to serve as the main entry point for the multi-page application, providing a welcome message and directing users to the sidebar.

## 2. Chatbot Integration Fixes

Several modifications were made to address issues preventing the chatbot from functioning correctly, primarily related to the `GEMINI_API_KEY` and the FastAPI application's structure.

### Key Changes:

*   **Robust `GEMINI_API_KEY` Handling:**
    *   The `GEMINI_API_KEY` is now explicitly retrieved using `os.getenv()` in `api/main.py` and passed directly to the `Chatbot` constructor. This ensures the API key is correctly loaded from the `.env` file and available to the `Chatbot` class.
    *   **Change in `api/main.py` (`get_chatbot` dependency):**
        ```python
        def get_chatbot():
            gemini_api_key = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")
            if not gemini_api_key:
                raise ValueError("GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable is not set.")
            return Chatbot(gemini_api_key=gemini_api_key)
        ```
    *   **Change in `chatbot/bot.py` (`__init__` method):** The `Chatbot` constructor now accepts `gemini_api_key` as an argument and uses it to configure `genai`. The previous `os.getenv` call and placeholder check were removed from this file.
        ```python
        class Chatbot:
            def __init__(self, gemini_api_key: str):
                if not gemini_api_key:
                    raise ValueError("Gemini API key is not provided.")
                genai.configure(api_key=gemini_api_key)
                self.embedding_model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
                self.llm = genai.GenerativeModel('models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest')
        ```
*   **Streamlined FastAPI Application (`api/main.py`):**
    *   The `api/main.py` file has been refactored to focus solely on serving the chatbot API.
    *   Removed the `EMARData` Pydantic model, `get_db` dependency, model loading logic (`joblib.load`, `json.load`), and the `/ingest` endpoint.
    *   The root endpoint (`/`) now provides a simpler message.
*   **Improved Error Reporting:** The `ask` method in `chatbot/bot.py` now includes the specific exception message when an error occurs during LLM response generation, aiding in debugging.
    *   **Change in `chatbot/bot.py` (`ask` method):**
        ```python
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error generating LLM response: {e}")
            return f"I'm sorry, I encountered an error while trying to generate a response: {e}"
        ```
*   **`.env` File Creation:** A `.env` file was created in the project root to store the `GEMINI_API_KEY` securely, which is loaded by `dotenv`.
    *   **File Content:** `GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` (User must replace placeholder).

These changes collectively enhance the dashboard's usability and resolve critical issues in the chatbot's functionality, making the project more robust and maintainable.
